**Motivation**
- Why is wealth concentrated in some geographic regions? 
- We all want to understand how to create a better tomorrow in the broadest sense

- Four contributions: Two about geography; Two about institutions 
- Based on natural experiments

# Introduction
.pull-left[
- Geography is more than soil quality. We are slaves of geomorphology.  
- In 1825 the Agger isthmus* broke by 1834 a natural channel had formed 
- 700 years prior a similar channel had silted up

#### What will be demonstrated:
  - The channel caused trade 
  - The channel caused a local population boom
  - Mechanisms
  - Evidence for the reverse natural experiment in 1100s

# Timeline

#### Pre-event: 
- 1085-1208: Natural western channel closed because of gradual land rises (since the last ice age)
- 1672: Eastern Limfjord town Aalborg 2nd largest in DK 
- Other Limfjord towns lacked far behind under Aalborg's local hedgemony

--

#### Event:
- 1825: Breach of Agger Isthmus
- 1834: Ships start consistently passing through a new natural channel 
- 1841: Independent trade rights to west Limfjord market towns 
- 1850-1900: [Secondary infrastructure and growth](#post-event) 
- 1860-1900: Strong(er) growth

# Empirical strategy

$$log(y_{it}) = Affected_i \times Year_t \beta_t + FE + \varepsilon_{it}$$

*Affected is:*
- The **West** Limfjord, or
- Improved **market access** after the breach

# Market Access
.pull-left[
Based on cost distance from parishes to harbours: 
$${MA}_p = \sum_{h \in H} [CostDist(p, h) + 1]^\theta \times W_{p}$$
- CostDist - Dijkstra's agorithm and 1/10 land/sea ratio 
- $\theta = -1$  
- Breach caused new harbours in West Limfjord: $H\rightarrow H^*$

$$MA_{before} = MA_p|H \\
MA_{after} = MA_p|H^*$$
Main measure:
$$\Delta log(MA) = log(MA_{after})-log(MA_{before})$$

## A Firm Level Analysis of the Impact of Religiousity on Productivity

### Coauthored with Jeanet Bentzen, Nina Boberg-Fazlic, Paul Sharp, Christian Volmar Skovsgaard

# Introduction

.pull-left[
- Danish industrialisation is the industrialisation of agriculture (Sharp & Lampe, 2019)
- Portrayed as a consequence of homogeneity and lack of conflict 
- But did conflict and religiosity play any role for Danish development?
- **Can non-violent religious conflicts also have adverse effects?**


- **Finding:** Religious conflict drove lower productivity

**Data:**
- Newly digitized data on Mission houses, when and where they were build 
- Operational Statistics of Creameries (Sharp et al, 2023) enriched with location 
- Haue (1978) provides list on Sunday closed creameries 
  + 11685 observations on 964 creameries
  + Milk, Butter, influence of IM and various controls
- Potential influence measured as market potential of IM
]

.pull-right[
**Empirical strategy:** 
- Milk butter ratio: How much milk does it take to produce a unit of butter?

$$MB_{it}= IM_{it}\beta_1+\mathbf{z}_{it}\gamma+FE+\varepsilon_{it}$$
$$ln(Butter_{it})= ln(Milk_{it})\beta_1+IM_{it}\beta_2+...$$

**Bartik style instruments:**
- Early IM would cause later IM (it is in the name)

## About the data
- Administrative database of all archaelogical sites and finds 
- Managed by ministry of culture 
- 321 generic types of findings. E.g. coins
- 1940 dated sites with coins between 750 and 1500

- Panel construction:
  + **Innovation:** Monte Carlo to estimate $P_i(Coin|t)$   
  + Probability that a coin finding was generated at a specific time

# Estimator of coin probability
.pull-left[
- **Objective:** We want to know *how likely it is that coin was left at a particular time $t$*
- **What we have:** Observations of individual coin findings and a distribution of times $t$, which are likely for a specific coin finding in a place $i$ 

**In equation form:**
- What we have: $P_i(t|c)$: Probability of $t$ given one coin 
- What we want: $P_i(\{c\}|t)$: Probability of *any* coins in time $t$
]
--
.pull-right[
### The solution
Bayes formula and Monte Carlo
- Simple to sample from this distribution
- Sample $t$ from each coin 
- Count frequency of coin findings
$$P(\{c\}|t)=\left[1-\prod_{c=1}^{K_i} \left( 1 - P(t|c) \right)\right] P(\{c\})$$
where it is assumed that
$P(t|c)\sim \mathscr{U}(Year_{min}^c; Year_{max}^c)$ or
$P(t|c)\sim \mathscr{N}(\mu_c, \sigma_c),$
$\sigma_c=\frac{(Year_{max}^c - Year_{min}^c)}{1.96}$

**Timeline**

**1657-1720:** General consumption tax in market towns and Dano-Swedish wars boosts timber/grain legal grey zone trade (*skudehandel*) between Thy and Norway.  
**1814:** Norway becomes Swedish. Illegal trade continues  
**1834-35:** Overwelmning trade with even larger ships. Coastal watch established. Thisted becomes de facto customs town.  
**1837, 1840:** Petitions to the King for formal international trading rights for all market towns
